David Deutsch's QIPC/HP sponsored short course "Lectures on Quantum Computation" transcribed w/ images in 2020 to PDF (work done by Ben Webb and Adrian German).
This GitHub mirror of the transcription work is technically not currently under granted any copyright from Prof. Deutsch but is just duplicating the transcription
pdf published at A. German's domain at legacy.cs.indiana.edu.

In addition to the transcript, I collected some of the "worked example" documents from the Quiprocone site.

David Deutsch, one of the world’s preeminent  quantum theorists, created a video introduction to the field of quantum computation.

The introduction is divided into six lectures: 
1. The Qubit  1:01:56
2. Interference  41:53
3. Measurement  43:09
4. The Schrödinger Picture  48:23
5. A Quantum Algorithm  46:00
6. Grover’s Search Algorithm  41:05

These lectures have a dual-use philosophy. They are designed to be an introduction to the quantum theory of computation for (say) graduate students intending to do research in the field.

Simultaneously, they are an introduction to quantum theory itself for (say) undergraduate physics students.
